# [Udacity Classic Arcade Game](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)


This game is showing how to create a game using HTML5(Canvas) and JS. This is based on enemies(bugs) and one player. The goal of the player is reach out the water without colliding into any one of the enemies. The difficult part is the fact that the enemies move fast across the field and they come out from everywhere 0/

A player can be moved to left, right, up and down using the arrows signs at your keyboard. Have fun :)
